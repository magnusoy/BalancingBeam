# BalancingBeam
An Arduino is used to balance a ball rolling on a beam. It uses an IR-Sensor for measurment and a PID-Controller controls the servo's output for lift.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to upload the code over to the Arduino Uno board.
The code utilize a number of open source libraries wich you need to download seperatly from the following sources:

* [PID](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library) - PID
* [Servo](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo) - Servo
* [IR-Sensor](https://github.com/DrGFreeman/SharpDistSensor) - IR-Sensor


### Installing and usage
Coming.

## Built With

* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Arduino
