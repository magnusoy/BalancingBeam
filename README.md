# BalancingBeam
An Arduino is used to balance a ball rolling on a beam. It uses an IR-Sensor for measurment and a PID-Controller controls the servo's output for lift.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to upload the code over to the Arduino Uno/Nano board.


### Installing

The code utilize a number of open source libraries wich is included under /libraries.

The following libraries that are included:
* [PID](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library) - PID
* [Servo](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo) - Servo
* [SharpDistSensor](https://github.com/DrGFreeman/SharpDistSensor) - SharpDistSensor

Copy all of the content in the /libraries folder and move them over to your own Arduino libraries folder.
This folder will often be in your Documents/Arduino folder.

You will now be able to open and run the script.

### Usage

Be sure your connections are connected right on the board and press Upload in Arduino IDE.
Then open Serial Monitor and you will be presented with the following information:

As stated in the Serial Monitor, you will be able to change the Setvalu at any given time by changing writing the value in the Serial Monitor.

PS: You might need to change the PID configurations to fit your construction. Change Kp, Ki, Kd until you are pleased with the result.
